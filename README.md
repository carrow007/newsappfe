# project-two

project outline. The Api has two endpoints one for grabbing articles 
and one for grabbing sources(they have a wide array of sources you can grab
from). My goal is to allow the user to select one or muliptle sources via 
dropdown or radio buttons and also slecet whether they want to see most 
popular, top or latest. Once the user selects the options then the disired
results will appear on the page. 

Similar to the "wander App" I would like to display the information in cards on the page.

API used: newsAPI.org

I had some pretty lofty goals going into this however I struggled a lot more with the backend and because of the time spent on trying to get that to work I was not able to deploy the app that I really wanted to deploy. If I could redo this project I would first focus on 3-4 news outlets to have a lot less code to keep track of and then expand to the full scope that they had once I figured it out with a couple of them.

The specs that I wanted for this app were:
    - ineractive cards 
    - displaying all the news for a particualr selection
    - saving individual articles
    - viewing all your saved articles
    - writing comments about a partiular article

I was not able to figure out the interactive part, but I was able to display the information on individual divs that printed the info. I really like where my news site could go so I plan on working on that when i have spare time going forward.

I tried placeing a favorite button in each div so that you could save on article at a time, but I was unable to do that. Instead I created a favorite button that would take all of the news displayed and place it in the backend. This took me more hours then I would have thought it would and becuase of it I was unable to implement other backend aspects. this inculdes the view all favorites which I should have working this coming week. The put or update method was a little tricky for me and I tried having it allow the user to write comments on a particular article, but I was unable to do that and will work on that moving forward. 

I learned a lot from this project and also realized that there is still a lot of things that I need to get better at going forward. At this point I am a lot more comfortable with the front end then I am with the backend.
